  <h2>Bio</h2>
  <p>My name is Jar Hsuan Sherry Wang. I am a enthusiastic Interactive Art and Technology student who wants to be a content strategist that is able to utilize various forms of  media to promote and raise awareness of different social topics. Emphasizing on media art, I mainly explore in  graphic design, game design, UX/UI design,videography and virtual reality to represent ideas in an effective way. Within different project, I am mainly in charge of storyboarding, content analysis,ensuring meaningful project goals and pinpointing problems by giving thoughtful suggestions.</p>
  <p>I strive to push myself to use emerging technology (like VR) to construct messages with the understanding of design principles and  integration of other disciplines like UX/UI design, game design, graphic design and videography.
  </p>

  <h2>Interests</h2>
  <p>I am interested in doing project managing, concept ideation, reiteration using storybroading, sketching and relevant design tools such as adobe suites and html/css, unity for visualizing and making mock ups and prototypes. Hence, any position that is related to project assuring and planning would be favourable.</p>
