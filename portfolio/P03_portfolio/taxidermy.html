    <h3 class="project-paragraph in-para-overview-title">Goal</h3>
    <p  class="project-paragraph">To make a 3-4 minute documentary-style video about the value of taxidermy for <em>The Wild Things</em> exhibition in the Museum of Vancouver.</p>
    <h3 class="project-paragraph in-para-overview-title">Teammates</h3>
    <p  class="project-paragraph">Justine Zhang, Tamiko Tadeo</p>
    <h3 class="project-paragraph in-para-overview-title">Time</h3>
    <p  class="project-paragraph"> 1 month</p>

    <h2 class="project-section-title">Brief</h2>
    <p class="project-paragraph first-paragraph">This was a school project for IAT 344, “Moving Images” where students were assigned to collaborate with real world clients and help them produce documentaries. Our group chose to work with the Museum of Vancouver. </p>

    <p class="project-paragraph"><em>The Wild Things</em> will be on display in late 2018 and will illustrate the positive relationship between human, technology and nature. After listening to the museum’s proposed concept, my team were interested in the opportunity to document the historical and cultural relationships between human and nature. Thus, we decided to film a documentary project on this topic. </p>

    <h2 class="project-section-title">Process</h2>
    <p class="project-paragraph">Different from a scripted film, making a documentary requires a lot more planning due to the unpredictability of the filming location and content. In order to minimize the uncertainty, my team decided to schedule a museum tour to get familiarize what could be our centre of attention. Before visiting the museum, I led my team in a brainstorming process where we created a set of moodboards, possible documentary composition, pre-production questions and colour palettes that could prepare us to envision the story messages and goals. The idea of “the coexistence of both nature and urbanization” came into mind at this stage of the process which led us to have more spaces to discuss with the museum. </p>

    </figure>

    <p class="project-paragraph">After visiting the museum and meeting with the museum curator, Viviane Gosslin, we were assigned taxidermy as a topic, due to the fact that there are fewer taxidermists than in the past. Thus,it would be valuable to document how people used to connect themselves to the nature and how taxidermy could be important in modern day context. In order to capture the positive message that the museum wanted us to portray, I led the group in creating guiding  questions for our upcoming interviews. How these questions were significant was that they helped us to form a cohesive message later on. At this stage, my team developed an overall message of an introduction to taxidermy and its values. </p>

    <p class="project-paragraph">Moreover after my team had determined our list of questions, I began storyboarding our documentary. By doing this, it helped my team to understand how we could set up the equipment quickly and film the subjects with purposes. Since on the storyboard, there were annotation that reminded each of us to capture artefacts that could help building our topic. After the pre-production preparation, we then went to the museum to film. </p>

    <p class="project-paragraph">Since the museum could only offer us up to 3 hours for filming in their storage room, we were only able to gather our footage into a rough cut during our first filming. Given our lack of footage, we request a second shooting time with the museum. I provided our shooting plan, consisting of potential artifacts that we could use to convey our desired message. I also provided our list of equipment that would help enhance the flow and composition of our film. In order to prevent accidents and uncertainty, I studied and practiced how to use the new equipment beforehand and coached the team to use them. </p>

    <h2 class="project-section-title">Challenge</h2>
    <p class="project-paragraph">I was responsible for post production (for example: colour correction and ensuring coherent content) while my teammates were in charge of editing and sound design.The challenge that we faced is that it was difficult for us to cut down the interview content and arrange them in a meaningful way. There were technical issues, for instance, cameras running out of batteries and dirty lens influencing the film quality that affect the amount of footages we could use. How we tried to tackle this issue was that we took a step back and re-watching all the salvageable footages and tried to arrange them following the guiding the questions that we had. We later on filled in the gap using the footages we shot during the second filming. Hence, this situation further emphasized the importance of pre-production preparation. </p>

    <h2 class="project-section-title">Reflection</h2>
    <p class="project-paragraph">The first screening of the documentary was played in School of Interactive Art and Technology Festival in Yaletown Roundhouse community centre. It would later on be played in the museum for the exhibition. </p>

    </figure>

    <p class="project-paragraph">What I have learnt from the project is the importance of pre-production preparation since it is very crucial for my team to respond quickly according to the unpredictable circumstances that might happen during shooting and editing. Unpredictability indeed gave my team a lot of stress. After this project, I had learnt to be more flexible and understanding when facing technical issues, scheduling issues and team conflicts. </p>
