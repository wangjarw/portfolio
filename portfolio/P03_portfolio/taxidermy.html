    <h2 class="project-section-title">Brief</h2>
    <p class="project-paragraph first-paragraph">This is a documentary project partnered with Museum of Vancouver under a school project context. This project was given in the class Moving Image where students were assigned to collaborate with real world clients and help them producing documentaries. </p>
    <p class="project-paragraph">The Wild Things is an exhibition that is going to happen in 2018. According to the Museum of Vancouver, this exhibition is going to illustrate the positive relationship between human, technology and nature. After listening to how the museum presented their concept, the team considered it was going to be interesting to document the historical and cultural relationships between human and nature. Thus, we decided to film a documentary project on this topic. </p>

    <h2 class="project-section-title">Process</h2>
    <p class="project-paragraph">Different from a scripted film, making a documentary requires a lot more planning due to the unpredictability of the filming location and content. In order to minimize the uncertainty, the team decided to schedule a museum tour to get familiarize what could be our centre of attention. Before visiting the museum, I guided the team to do the brainstorming process by creating a set of moodboards, possible documentary composition, pre-production questions and colour palettes that could prepare us to envision the story messages and goals. The idea of “the coexistence of both nature and urbanization” came into mind at this stage of the process which led us to have more spaces to discuss with the museum. </p>

    <p class="project-paragraph">After visiting the museum, the museum assigned us the topic of taxidermy since nowadays people do not produce taxidermy anymore. It would be valuable to document how people used to connect themselves to the nature and how taxidermy could be important in modern day context. In order to capture the positive message that the museum wanted us to portray, I led the entire group to collectively came up with guiding interview questions for relevant museum interviewees. How these questions were significant was that they helped us to form a cohesive message later on. At this stage, the team developed an overall message of an introduction to taxidermy and its values. </p>

    <p class="project-paragraph">Moreover, after the team had written down the question set, I later on started to do storyboarding. By doing storyboarding, it helped the team to understand how we could set up the equipment quickly and film the subjects with purposes since on the storyboard, there were annotation that reminded each of us to capture artefacts that could help building our topic. After the pre-production preparation, we then went to the museum to film. </p>

    <p class="project-paragraph">Since the museum could only offer us 1-3 hours of time to film inside their storage room, during our first filming, we were only able to gather our footages into a rough cut. Hence, we asked for a second shooting with them. In order to fill up the gap for the central message, I listed out another shooting plan consisting of potential artefacts that we could use to portray the overall message better and equipments that could help enhancing the flow and composition of the film. In order to prevent accidents and uncertainty, I studied and practiced how to use the new equipment beforehand and coached the team to use them. </p>

    <h2 class="project-section-title">Challenge</h2>
    <p class="project-paragraph">My teammates were in charge of editing as well as sound design and I was doing post production such as doing colour correction and making sure the content was coherent. The challenge that we faced is that it was difficult for us to cut down the interview content and arrange them in a meaningful way. There were technical issues, for instance, cameras running out of batteries and dirty lens influencing the film quality that affect the amount of footages we could use. How we tried to tackle this issue was that we took a step back and re-watching all the salvageable footages and tried to arrange them following the guiding the questions that we had. We later on filled in the gap using the footages we shot during the second filming. Hence, this situation further emphasized the importance of pre-production preparation. </p>

    <h2 class="project-section-title">Reflection</h2>
    <p class="project-paragraph">The first screening of the documentary was played in School of Interactive Art and Technology Festival in Yaletown Roundhouse community centre. It would later on be played in the museum for the exhibition. </p>

    <p class="project-paragraph">What I have learnt from the project is the importance of pre-production preparation since it is very crucial for the team to respond quickly according to the unpredictable circumstances that might happen during shooting and editing. Unpredictability indeed gave the team a lot of stress. After this project, I had learnt to be more flexible and understanding when facing technical issues, scheduling issues and team conflicts. </p>
    <!-- <p class="project-paragraph first-paragraph">This project is collaboration between the class, Moving Images in SFU with Museum of Vancouver’s upcoming exhibition, The Wild Things. The aim for this project is to create a documentary that describes a positive relationship between human and nature. Different from a scripted film, making a documentary requires a lot more planning due to the unpredictability. Before the museum assigning the team specific topic, I was in charge of envisioning the final outcomes and gathering potential ideas and questions by directing the team members to construct a primary mood board with our first decided colour scheme as well as possible compositions and a list of questions for the museum to answer for our first visit. </p>

  <figCaption>This is the first storyboard that was sketched out by me to highlight the possible concepts and artefacts that might show up during the filming. This pre-production helped the team to film without hesitation and uncertainty.</figCaption>
</figure>

<p class="project-paragraph">After the tour, the museum informed us that our team could focus on the topic of birds and they were going to prepare potential interviewees that individually represent scientific, historical and cultural aspects of the relationship between human and nature. Before the first filming, I organized the notes taken during the visit to plan out a set of storyboards that cover the all possible key concepts, artefacts and compositions to prevent time wasting. On the day of filming, every team member including me took term to use cameras and audio recorders to capture B-rolls at Iona Beach Regional Park and A-rolls with the interviewee in them. Guiding the filming process smoothly, I was account for making sure to record as many as footages for content editing afterward.</p>

<p class="project-paragraph">Nevertheless, the biggest challenge we faced is that all of our interviewees withdrew from the project. Also, there were some difficulty in communication between us and the museum to follow up with the situation. Due to this sudden change in schedule, we were only left with almost one month to produce the film. In order to solve this barrier, the team decided to contact the museum with the help of the instructor. At the end, we were settled down with a new topic: taxidermy. Since we did not have much time, I was in charge of making storyboard again and gathering all the team members to construct a new set of questions so that we were able to precisely capture the footages we needed since we already knew how things were like during the first visit to the museum.</p>

<p class="project-paragraph">This film was played for School of Interactive Art and Technology Festival in Yaletown Roundhouse community centre. The promotional poster was designed by me using Justine’s taxidermy photo. Overall, I learnt that documentary indeed needs extra planning. Although it might seem like everything was unpredictable, it was actually really important to plan possible outcome and get as much information as possible for the topic and the locations. </p>
