    <h3 class="project-paragraph in-para-overview-title">Goal</h3>
    <p  class="project-paragraph">a 3-4 min long exhibition documentary video about the value of taxidermy for The Wild Things exhibition in Museum of Vancouver.</p>
    <h3 class="project-paragraph in-para-overview-title">Teammates</h3>
    <p  class="project-paragraph">Justine Zhang, Tamiko Tadeo</p>
    <h3 class="project-paragraph in-para-overview-title">Time</h3>
    <p  class="project-paragraph"> 1 month</p>

    <h2 class="project-section-title">Brief</h2>
    <p class="project-paragraph first-paragraph">This is a documentary project partnered with Museum of Vancouver under a school project context. This project was given in the class Moving Image where students were assigned to collaborate with real world clients and help them producing documentaries. </p>
    <p class="project-paragraph">The Wild Things is an exhibition that is going to happen in 2018. According to the Museum of Vancouver, this exhibition is going to illustrate the positive relationship between human, technology and nature. After listening to how the museum presented their concept, the team considered it was going to be interesting to document the historical and cultural relationships between human and nature. Thus, we decided to film a documentary project on this topic. </p>

    <h2 class="project-section-title">Process</h2>
    <p class="project-paragraph">Different from a scripted film, making a documentary requires a lot more planning due to the unpredictability of the filming location and content. In order to minimize the uncertainty, the team decided to schedule a museum tour to get familiarize what could be our centre of attention. Before visiting the museum, I guided the team to do the brainstorming process by creating a set of moodboards, possible documentary composition, pre-production questions and colour palettes that could prepare us to envision the story messages and goals. The idea of “the coexistence of both nature and urbanization” came into mind at this stage of the process which led us to have more spaces to discuss with the museum. </p>

    </figure>

    <p class="project-paragraph">After visiting the museum, the museum assigned us the topic of taxidermy since nowadays people do not produce taxidermy anymore. It would be valuable to document how people used to connect themselves to the nature and how taxidermy could be important in modern day context. In order to capture the positive message that the museum wanted us to portray, I led the entire group to collectively came up with guiding interview questions for relevant museum interviewees. How these questions were significant was that they helped us to form a cohesive message later on. At this stage, the team developed an overall message of an introduction to taxidermy and its values. </p>

    <p class="project-paragraph">Moreover, after the team had written down the question set, I later on started to do storyboarding. By doing storyboarding, it helped the team to understand how we could set up the equipment quickly and film the subjects with purposes since on the storyboard, there were annotation that reminded each of us to capture artefacts that could help building our topic. After the pre-production preparation, we then went to the museum to film. </p>

    <p class="project-paragraph">Since the museum could only offer us 1-3 hours of time to film inside their storage room, during our first filming, we were only able to gather our footages into a rough cut. Hence, we asked for a second shooting with them. In order to fill up the gap for the central message, I listed out another shooting plan consisting of potential artefacts that we could use to portray the overall message better and equipments that could help enhancing the flow and composition of the film. In order to prevent accidents and uncertainty, I studied and practiced how to use the new equipment beforehand and coached the team to use them. </p>

    <h2 class="project-section-title">Challenge</h2>
    <p class="project-paragraph">My teammates were in charge of editing as well as sound design and I was doing post production such as doing colour correction and making sure the content was coherent. The challenge that we faced is that it was difficult for us to cut down the interview content and arrange them in a meaningful way. There were technical issues, for instance, cameras running out of batteries and dirty lens influencing the film quality that affect the amount of footages we could use. How we tried to tackle this issue was that we took a step back and re-watching all the salvageable footages and tried to arrange them following the guiding the questions that we had. We later on filled in the gap using the footages we shot during the second filming. Hence, this situation further emphasized the importance of pre-production preparation. </p>

    <h2 class="project-section-title">Reflection</h2>
    <p class="project-paragraph">The first screening of the documentary was played in School of Interactive Art and Technology Festival in Yaletown Roundhouse community centre. It would later on be played in the museum for the exhibition. </p>

    </figure>

    <p class="project-paragraph">What I have learnt from the project is the importance of pre-production preparation since it is very crucial for the team to respond quickly according to the unpredictable circumstances that might happen during shooting and editing. Unpredictability indeed gave the team a lot of stress. After this project, I had learnt to be more flexible and understanding when facing technical issues, scheduling issues and team conflicts. </p>
