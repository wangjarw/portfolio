    <p>This project happened under the context of a social entrepreneurial class allowing people from different disciplines to collaborate together in order to solve a certain issue that we considered significant. The team I worked with consisted mostly people with business and health science background. Hence, inside this group context, I was the main designer in charge of convincing and explaining design principles and technological trends to lay audience. Due to the fact that most of our members came from a different background and SFU having an international outlook, we considered it was appropriate to tackle international/ immigrant student issues such as social isolation and language barriers. After deciding on our topic, so as to validate our assumption, the team collectively conducted empathy map interviews on international students to evaluate and observe the root causes of their issue and anxiety. This assumption was later on being confirmed by the interviewees. During the brainstorming process, the team paid a lot attention on international students who were already here in Canada but I quickly spotted the blind spot of the discussion: our solution only benefited international students who were already here in Canada and we had neglected other potential oversea students planning to come to Canada. Hence, an online virtual game with social experience was introduced by me. In order to convince the team, I conducted online surveys to SFU students to both confirm the needs and the interests. This idea was also pitched as a team in a community feedback session with simple imaginative game mock ups sketched by me to describe the concepts.</p>

    <p>The biggest challenge that I faced in this project was that since my team mates were mostly business students, they were often times questioning the aspect of budget and the implementation. Originally, the idea of doing an actual virtual reality platform was brought up by me since VR was able to offer great engagement with high presence to assist the overseas students to get to know more about Canada and make friends before landing. Nevertheless, I overlooked the accessibility of the technology. Hence, the team decided to make this social game into a simpler online game that was going to be multi-platforms where the students can control their avatars on any device to explore environment around SFU.</p>

    <p>What I learnt from this experience was that as a designer, the practice of collecting insights from the potential users and customers is important. When we are designing for an idea, we typically think the users would understand our intention so we neglect the thought of validating our proposed concept to our users. After this project, I had become much more user-centric and to assist users.</p>
