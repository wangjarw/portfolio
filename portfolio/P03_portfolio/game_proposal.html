    <h2 class="project-section-title">Brief</h2>
    <p class="project-paragraph first-paragraph">This project was given as a school project in the business course, Introduction to Entrepreneurship and Innovation. The course itself encouraged interdisciplinary collaboration so most of students participated in the course were from different majors. This context allowed me to work with people who had zero design background. Hence, as a designer, I would have to communicate and convince a group of lay audience about basic understanding of design and technological tools. </p>
    <p class="project-paragraph">For this project specifically, the goal was to propose an entrepreneurial solution to a social issue that we considered was important enough. Due to all of our team members including me coming from diverse backgrounds and I was once an international student peer mentor, I advocated to promote international studentsâ€™ experience in school. So at the end, the team agreed to tackle international/ immigrant student issues such as social isolation and language barriers.</p>

    <h2 class="project-section-title">Process</h2>
    <p class="project-paragraph">After deciding our topic, the team conducted a collective empathy map interviews to randomly selected international students. These questions included what they were thinking, what they were actually saying and what I observed to avoid biased comments. This root cause analysis validated our initial concern and observations. After initial set of interviews, the team decided to brainstorm on proposals that could potentially resolve the language barrier issue and social isolation. Nevertheless, the team came up with ideas that were beneficial to the international student community that were already in Canada. During one of the follow-up interviews I had with an international student, I found out the team overlooked an important root cause of these anxiety issues: the negligence of international students who were planning to come to Canada. Hence, I brought up an idea of building an online virtual game using either VR or conventional game platform to tackle this issue. </p>

    <p class="project-paragraph">Later on, I conducted an online survey for to test our hypothesis and our potential solution. This survey not only included our target segment but also included a more general audience, other domestic students since social isolation was also an issue that a lot of the local students were facing. The survey result supported our proposal.</p>

    <p class="project-paragraph">Inspired by Second Life, we proposed to offer all students to have access to this game. They could enter the virtual world to interact with different people and engage in school events. There was also an online chatting feature to help international students to mingle with domestic students.</p>

    <h2 class="project-section-title">Challenge</h2>
    <p class="project-paragraph">The biggest challenge for this project was the potential budget limitation and technological accessibility issues that were discovered through the business model canvas. Originally, we were thinking to actually build a VR platform to offer high presence engagement to familiarize more about Canada and the campus before landing. However, not everyone would have the tools and it would be too expensive to develop a 3D platform covering campus area. As results, the team decided to make this social game into a simpler multi-platform game where the students can control their avatars on common devices to explore environment around SFU.</p>

    <h2 class="project-section-title">Reflection</h2>
    <p class="project-paragraph">This project was also pitched as a team in a community feedback session with simple imaginative game mock ups sketched by me to describe the concepts. The feedback we received for this project was improving our possible revenue stream and further developing the details of the game dynamics to retain the users. Overall the project was interesting enough. </p>
    <p class="project-paragraph">User research was the major thing that I learnt through this experience. When we are designing for an idea, we typically think the users would understand our intention so we neglect the thought of validating our proposed concept to our users. Hence, after this project, I had become more aware of user researches. </p>
    <!-- <p class="project-paragraph first-paragraph">This project happened under the context of a social entrepreneurial class allowing people from different disciplines to collaborate together in order to solve a certain issue that we considered significant. The team I worked with consisted mostly people with business and health science background. Hence, inside this group context, I was the main designer in charge of convincing and explaining design principles and technological trends to lay audience. Due to the fact that most of our members came from a different background and SFU having an international outlook, we considered it was appropriate to tackle international/ immigrant student issues such as social isolation and language barriers. After deciding on our topic, so as to validate our assumption, the team collectively conducted empathy map interviews on international students to evaluate and observe the root causes of their issue and anxiety. This assumption was later on being confirmed by the interviewees. During the brainstorming process, the team paid a lot attention on international students who were already here in Canada but I quickly spotted the blind spot of the discussion: our solution only benefited international students who were already here in Canada and we had neglected other potential oversea students planning to come to Canada. Hence, an online virtual game with social experience was introduced by me. In order to convince the team, I conducted online surveys to SFU students to both confirm the needs and the interests. This idea was also pitched as a team in a community feedback session with simple imaginative game mock ups sketched by me to describe the concepts.</p> -->

    <figCaption>I deliberately include all the student groups into this project since according to this survey, it seems like not only the inter national student community facing the problem of social isolation, domestic students also face the same issue. Hence, we are thinking to also include doemstic students to interact with each other inside our virtual world.</figCaption>

<p class="project-paragraph">The biggest challenge that I faced in this project was that since my team mates were mostly business students, they were often times questioning the aspect of budget and the implementation. Originally, the idea of doing an actual virtual reality platform was brought up by me since VR was able to offer great engagement with high presence to assist the overseas students to get to know more about Canada and make friends before landing. Nevertheless, I overlooked the accessibility of the technology. Hence, the team decided to make this social game into a simpler online game that was going to be multi-platforms where the students can control their avatars on any device to explore environment around SFU.</p>

<figCaption>This is a screenshot of a proposed game environment produced by me. Inspired by Second Life, we are thinking to offer the users which is our student to have access to this game, just like the way they have their access to Canvas space. They can right away get into the virtual world to interact with different people and engage in school events. There is also option of online chatting to help international students to overcome language barrier.</figCaption>

<p class="project-paragraph">What I learnt from this experience was that as a designer, the practice of collecting insights from the potential users and customers is important. When we are designing for an idea, we typically think the users would understand our intention so we neglect the thought of validating our proposed concept to our users. After this project, I had become much more user-centric and to assist users.</p>
