  <p>This project is collaboration between the class, Moving Images in SFU with Museum of Vancouver’s upcoming exhibition, The Wild Things. The aim for this project is to create a documentary that describes a positive relationship between human and nature. Different from a scripted film, making a documentary requires a lot more planning due to the unpredictability. Before the museum assigning the team specific topic, I was in charge of envisioning the final outcomes and gathering potential ideas and questions by directing the team members to construct a primary mood board with our first decided colour scheme as well as possible compositions and a list of questions for the museum to answer for our first visit. </p>

    <figCaption>The first moodboard on the left is the first moodboard being created before the first visit to the museum. It focuses more on the separation of urban spaces and nature spaces to portray how they are able to coexist and what humans are able to sustain this positive relationship. Nevertheless, we were later on assigned the topic ‘birds’ to work with. Hence, we came up with a new moodboard that consists of possible shot compositions and colour schemes to convey a lively atmosphere.</figCaption>

  <p>After the tour, the museum informed us that our team could focus on the topic of birds and they were going to prepare potential interviewees that individually represent different aspects of the relationship between birds and human. Former member from the WildResearch, Christine Rock, bird lovers, Jude Grass and Al Grass and first nation people from Tsleil-Waututh nation were scheduled for us get information about the scientific, historical and cultural aspects of the topic. My teammate then contacted Christine to confirm with the interview date. Before the first filming, I organized the notes taken during the visit to plan out a set of storyboards that cover the all possible key concepts, artefacts and compositions to prevent time wasting. The team also had a phone interview before filming for confirmation of content with the museum curator, Viviane Gosslin who wanted to have more ideas about on social connection and passionate encounter between people and nature in the film. On the day of filming, every team member including me took term to use cameras and audio recorders to capture B-rolls at Iona Beach Regional Park and A-rolls with Christine in them. Guiding the filming process smoothly, I was account for making sure to record as many as footages for content editing afterward.</p>

    Nevertheless, the biggest challenge we faced is that all of our interviewees withdrew from the project due to personal issues and weather condition since we had to go into the nature to film birds. Also, there were some difficulty in communication between us and the museum to follow up with the situation. Due to this sudden change in schedule, we were only left with almost one month to produce the film. In order to solve this barrier, the team decided to contact the museum with the help of the instructor. At the end, we were settled down with a new topic: taxidermy. Since we did not have much time, I was in charge of making storyboard again and gathering all the team members to construct a new set of questions so that we were able to precisely capture the footages we needed since we already knew how things were like during the first visit to the museum.</p>

    <p>this is the second tour to the museum so that the team were able to pinpont what to look out for.</p>

      This film was played for School of Interactive Art and Technology Festival in Yaletown Roundhouse community centre. The promotional poster was designed by me using Justine’s taxidermy photo. Overall, I learnt that documentary indeed needs extra planning. Although it might seem like everything was unpredictable, it was actually really important to plan possible outcome and get as much information as possible for the topic and the locations.
