  <p>This project is collaboration between the class, Moving Images in SFU with Museum of Vancouver’s upcoming exhibition, The Wild Things. The aim for this project is to create a documentary that describes a positive relationship between human and nature. Different from a scripted film, making a documentary requires a lot more planning due to the unpredictability. Before the museum assigning the team specific topic, I was in charge of envisioning the final outcomes and gathering potential ideas and questions by directing the team members to construct a primary mood board with our first decided colour scheme as well as possible compositions and a list of questions for the museum to answer for our first visit. </p>
